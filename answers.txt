What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge is used to join two or more development histories together.
Rebase is used to commit on top of another base branch.

The difference between the two is that merge preserves the history of the repository while rebase
moves the feature branch onto the top of the main branch. Rebase rewrites the history.


What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version of your project that is hosted on the Internet or other network servers,
somewhere other than your local machine.
